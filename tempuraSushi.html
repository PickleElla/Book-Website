			<h2>Where I Found The Best Tempura</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>King of the Roll - Corte Madera, Larkspur</li>
			<p>This is a small family run Sushi Reasturant in Corte Madera. King of the Roll had long since been my family's favorite sushi place for almost a decade. While their tempura has much variety and flavor, almost perfectly made, their other rolls, udon, and their overall service is stellar.</p>
					<br>
			<li>TenTen - Orange County, Los Angeles</li>
			<p>TenTen is a high end Sushi Place at the edges of Los Angeles. Their food is amazing of course, but their interior decor and presentation of the rolls they serve really takes the cake. The modern mixed with traditional design really took my breath away.</p>
					<br>
			<li>Hikari Bullet Train Sushi & Bar-Japantown, San Francisco</li>
			<p>This restaurant in Japantown has some of the best sushi I have ever had. Their tempura was definatly diserving of belonging in my top three restaurants. Along with amazing food, this is also a "Bullet Train" or "Conveyor Belt" sushi place. Plates of sushi and other food run around the restaurant. </p>

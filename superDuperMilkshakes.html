		<p>Chocolate Milkshakes (the best flavor of milkshakes, I'm right, don't try) are very popular but it is very difficult to find milkshakes that are truly good. I have found some pretty eye opening and amazing milkshakes around the world. Below are my favorite places to get milkshakes, specifically chocolate ones. I especially reccomend the Shorline Cafe, their milkshakes are organic and fresh and their lunch and brunch is amazing as well.</p>

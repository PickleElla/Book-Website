		<h1>Monterey Bay Skillet Cookie</h1>
		
		<p>This cookie, baked in a skillet over a flame to perfection, I first had when I was seven years old. I loved this cookie so much that for the next four years I would be searching for a cookie of similar greatness, to no avail. This cookie, dough on top of melted chocolate with whipped cream and fresh strawberries at the top, is served at a bayside restaurant that serves stellar food as well as this cookie. 10/10, recomended.</p>

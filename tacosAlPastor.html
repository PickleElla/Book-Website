		<h1>Tacos Al Pastor</h1>
		<p>I have been eating Tacos al Pastor for all my life, the slow seared meat is spun around to get cooked from all sides, making ripe, juicy, and delitous meat. The beef is topped with onions, cilantro, and roasted pinapple, all put over a fresh corn tortilla. This, toped with salsa and other such toppings, is hands down one of the best meals in the world.</p>

		<h2>Picante - Bellam Blvd, San Rafael</h2>
		<p>Picante Taqueria in Ran Rafael is the hands down best place to get Tacos Al Pastor in the Bay Area. Picante has a lot of amazing mexican dishes that are all absolutly mouth-wattering. Here is where look at Picante or their locations as well as their other meals: https://www.yelp.com/biz/picante-taqueria-san-rafael. A note: while Picante is the best tacos in Marin, even the whole Bay Area, the best Tacos Al Pastor will be on the slow curcular meat fyer that can be found in many smaller places.</p>
